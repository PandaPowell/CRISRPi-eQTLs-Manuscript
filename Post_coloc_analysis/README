# Post-Colocalization Analysis
**Author:** Sam Ghatan  
**Last updated:** March 20, 2025

This directory contains all code used for downstream analyses following fine-mapping and colocalization of GWAS loci.

### Overview
The pipeline performs the following steps:

1. **Gene target identification**
   - Intersects fine-mapped variants with:
     - CRISPRi spacer sequences to identify **cGenes**
     - eQTL sentinel variants to identify **eGenes**

2. **Comparative analyses**
   - Compares cGenes and eGenes in terms of:
     - Genomic and regulatory properties
     - Overlaps with gold-standard gene sets
     - Associations with CRE (cis-regulatory element) features
     - Hi-C-based gene targets

### Notes
- Scripts are modular and grouped by analysis stage.
- Data input assumes completed fine-mapping and coloc analyses.

For details on usage, see individual script headers or contact the author.
